            <ol>
                <li>Gather all the ingredients.</li>
                <li>Thinly slice the onion and chop the mitsuba (or green onions). Beat one egg in a small bowl (you will need to beat the other egg when you work on the second batch).</li>
                <li>Slice the chicken thighs diagonally into pieces that are about 1½-inches (4 cm) long and ½-inch (1.3 cm) thick. I recommend using the “sogigiri” cutting technique so the chicken pieces will be of equal thickness and to create more surface area for fast cooking.</li>
                <li>With the stove off, add 1 serving of the sliced onions to the pan in a single layer. Add roughly one-third to one-half of the seasonings mixture (the amount may vary depending on the size of your frying pan). Pour just enough on top to cover the onions.</li>
                <li>Add 1 serving of the chicken on top of the onions. Make sure the onions and chicken are evenly distributed. Then, turn on the heat to medium and bring it to a boil.</li>
                <li>Once boiling, lower the heat to medium low. Skim off any foam or scum that appears. Cover and cook for about 5 minutes or until the chicken is no longer pink and the onions are tender.</li>
                <li>Taste the broth and see if you need to adjust. Slowly drizzle the beaten egg evenly over the chicken and onions. Cook covered on medium-low heat until the egg is done to your liking. Usually, oyakodon in Japan is served while the egg is almost set but still runn</li>
